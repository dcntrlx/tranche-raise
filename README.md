# Tranche Raise

**Tranche Raise** is a decentralized platform designed to provide way for projects to raise funds from investors. Future distribution of funds is governed by investor votes, ensuring that project milestones are met before further capital is released.

## Features
-   **Campaign Creation**: Project owners can launch fundraising campaigns with specific goals and timelines.
-   **Tranche-Based Fundraising**: Funds are released in stages (tranches) rather than all at once, protecting investor capital.
-   **Investor Voting**: Investors have voting rights proportional to their contribution to approve or deny the release of subsequent tranches.
-   **Transparent Distribution**: All fund movements and voting results are recorded on the blockchain for complete transparency.
